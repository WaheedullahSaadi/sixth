        <p class="a"><em>no words are enough to complement the unperalaled charm and unprecedented beauty of both the waziristans 
    .but there are some speacial picnic points in both the waziristans
     .the most famuos area as a beauty is shiwall which is taken place in both  the waziristans 
     .without this there are many beautifull picnic points in waziristan one of them is Badar that is my native area as well and there is no 
     deying that if the government had concintrated upon Waziristsn now Waziristan would be indeed second Kashmeer there are three season in
      waziristan <br>
     1/winter <br>
     2/fallen <br>
     3/interesting seson of spring
     mean Waziristan has three pitures every yer for his torists <br>
     1/the picture of winter season which is very intresting specialy for those people who
     are fond of torism becouse whoever has visited waziristan in snowing weather he had become 
     the desirios of visiting waziristan time to time <br>
     2/fallen season of waziristan it is so cresting fallen season
      of waziristan becouse it finishs the most beutyfull season of waziristan and forces the people
       of waziristan upon migreting from their home land becouse of unevilability of foundamental fasilities of leading in waziristan 
       .becouse there comes to mouch cold after fallen season in waziristan and it snows after that in waziristan
        which is actualy so interesting bseason
        but unlukily becouse of being devoid of foundamental facilities of leading
    life in this to mouch the people of waziristan are not able to spend their lives comfortably <br>
    3/spring season of waziristan is the most interesting and beautiful season of waziristan in which waziristan is full of grass if you
     will visit waziristan in this season you 
     will find beauty, fertility, everywhere in this season all the medows of waziristan are green fully falls are full of wter fountains
      boil like engry sea flowers shine like stars in the medows and sky touching mountains invite every one to visit of waziristan
